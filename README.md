tasks from course JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structure, but on Python


-----------
Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as 
-----------
Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted.
-----------
Write a function called sameFrequency Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.Your solution MUST have the following complexities:Time: O(N). 
-----------
Implement a function called, areThereDuplicates  which accepts a variable number of arguments, and checks whether there are any duplicates among the arguments passed in.  You can solve this using the frequency counter pattern OR the multiple pointers pattern. Time - O(n), Space - O(n).
